<p><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

<p><em><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></em></p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

<ul>
	<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><strong>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &#39;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&#39; below.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at badran.alshaikh@aol.com.</p>

<p><strong>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&#39;DNT&#39;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
